# Financial_analysis
## Introduction
As part of the "Financial Markets and Portfolio Management" course, the purpose of this report is to present a financial analysis of a time series, in particular that of APPLE "prices".

To do this I made a search in the Yahoo platform, in particular "Yahoo-Finance", to have a database that will allow me to have a general idea on the behavior of the variables, namely : Open, High, Low, Close, Adj.Close, Volume " according to the variable " Date ".

## Objectives, Materials and Tools
###### Objectives :
Financial analysis is a set of methods, approaches and tools that allows to study and judge the financial situation and results of a company or a group of companies.

It is in this context that my work can be anchored. Its main goal is to respond, at the level of various aspects, to a certain number of objectives that I have previously set, namely :
- Presentation and analysis of data (descriptive statistics).
- Estimates and Tests (Inference, Time Series): Theoretical reminders, estimators, laws, reading R outputs.
- Validation of statistical properties (properties of financial data).
- Modeling and prediction using time series.
- Modeling and prediction using smoothing techniques .

###### Materials and tools :
When processing the data, I opted for the R language, which is considered to be the most powerful program for statistics. There are several reasons for this choice:
- The R language is an open source language 
- Ease of handling small databases like mine
- Generation of representative graphs (All graphs of the report are outputs of the R language)

***You will find attached the report of the work, as well as the source code.
